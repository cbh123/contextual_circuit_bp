TODO

1) Training script. Don't forget to tf.add_n([lambda * v for k, v in model.regularizations.iteritems()]).
2) Evaluation script: Visualizations w/ LRP + plotting loss curves + plotting accuracy curves across multiple models.
3) DEBUG
4) Fix the contextual model implementation. A) Think about optimal bio CRF/eCRF sizes. B) Add the ability to automatically learn these from the data
